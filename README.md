#### A guide covering ARM architecture including the applications and tools that will make you a better and more efficient ARM developer.

## ARM Resources

[ARM](https://www.arm.com/) stands for Advanced RISC Machine, which is a collection of reduced instruction set computing architectures for CPUs configured for various development environments such servers, IoT, and other mobile devices. Arm was acquired by [NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com/page/home.html) in [September 2020](https://www.arm.com/company/news/2020/09/nvidia-to-acquire-arm).

## Apple Silicon Resources

[Apple A12Z Bionic](https://www.apple.com/) is Apple's 64-bit ARM-based system on a chip (SoC) used in their iPhones adn iPads. Though, at WWDC 2020 it was announced that [Apple Silicon](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon) would [transition into Mac laptops](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/06/apple-announces-mac-transition-to-apple-silicon/).
