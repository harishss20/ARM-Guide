#### A guide covering ARM architecture including the applications and tools that will make you a better and more efficient ARM developer.

## ARM Resources

[ARM](https://www.arm.com/) stands for Advanced RISC Machine, which is a collection of reduced instruction set computing architectures for CPUs configured for various development environments such servers, IoT, and other mobile devices. Arm was acquired by [NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com/page/home.html) in [September 2020](https://www.arm.com/company/news/2020/09/nvidia-to-acquire-arm).
