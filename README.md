#### A guide covering ARM architecture including the applications and tools that will make you a better and more efficient ARM developer.

## ARM Resources

[ARM](https://www.arm.com/) stands for Advanced RISC Machine, which is a collection of reduced instruction set computing architectures for CPUs configured for various development environments such servers, IoT, and other mobile devices. Arm was acquired by [NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com/page/home.html) in [September 2020](https://www.arm.com/company/news/2020/09/nvidia-to-acquire-arm).

## Apple Silicon Resources

[Apple A12Z Bionic](https://www.apple.com/) is Apple's 64-bit ARM-based system on a chip (SoC) used in their iPhones adn iPads. Though, at WWDC 2020 it was announced that [Apple Silicon](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon) would [transition into Mac laptops](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/06/apple-announces-mac-transition-to-apple-silicon/).

## Tools

[Arm Mobile Studio](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/graphics-and-gaming/arm-mobile-studio) is a suite of free-to-use performance analysis tools that automatically analyzes the CPU activity, GPU activity and content metrics of your game as it runs on a non-rooted Android device. 

[Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Tools](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-azurearmtools) is an extension for Visual Studio Code that provides language support, resource snippets, and resource auto-completion to help you create and validate Azure Resource Manager templates.

[Compute Library](https://github.com/ARM-software/ComputeLibrary) is a set of computer vision and machine learning functions optimised for both Arm CPUs and GPUs using SIMD technologies.

[LISA](https://github.com/ARM-software/lisa) is a project provides a toolkit that supports regression testing and interactive analysis of Linux kernel behavior. LISA stands for Linux Integrated/Interactive System Analysis. LISA's goal is to help Linux kernel developers to measure the impact of modifications in core parts of the kernel. The focus is on the scheduler (EAS), power management and thermal frameworks. 

[simdjson](https://simdjson.org/) library uses commonly available SIMD instructions and microparallel algorithms to parse gigabytes of JSON per second.

[TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/) is a Go compiler(based on LLVM) intended for use in small places such as microcontrollers, WebAssembly (Wasm), and command-line tools.

[Unicorn](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn) is a lightweight, multi-platform, multi-architecture CPU emulator framework(ARM, AArch64, M68K, Mips, Sparc, X86) based on [QEMU]().

[Tock](https://www.tockos.org/) is an embedded operating system designed for running multiple concurrent, mutually distrustful applications on Cortex-M and RISC-V based embedded platforms. Tock's design centers around protection, both from potentially malicious applications and from device drivers. 

[Keystone](https://github.com/keystone-engine/keystone) is a lightweight multi-platform, multi-architecture(Arm, Arm64, Hexagon, Mips, PowerPC, Sparc, SystemZ & X86) assembler framework.

[faasd](https://openfaas.com/blog/introducing-faasd/) is a project similar to [OpenFaaS](https://github.com/openfaas/), but without the cost and complexity of Kubernetes. It runs on a single host with very modest requirements, making it fast and easy to manage. Under the hood it uses [containerd](https://containerd.io/) and [Container Networking Interface (CNI)](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni) along with the same core OpenFaaS components from the main project.
